RISK IDENTIFICATION
8.2.2 Identify assets -  We did this with our assets table
8.2.3 Identify threats - We did this with our threats and vulnerabilities, first working out what a threat was then the vulnerability e.g. our keylogger debate
8.2.4 Idenitfy current controls (not relevant to asssesment IMO)
8.2.5 Identify vulnerabilities - We did this with our threats and vulnerabilities, first working out what a threat was then the vulnerability e.g. our keylogger debate
8.2.6 Identify consequences - We did this with our risk desciption in threats and vulnerabilties 

8.3.2 Assessment of consequences -  Impact table
8.3.3 Assessment of incident likelihood -  Likelihood table
8.3.4 Level of risk determination - Risk level in risk register actual

9 Information security risk treatment -  We did this with our proposed controls

Annex E provides risk matrices we could use and cite

Annex C provides extra threats in case we need more
Annex D extar vulnerabilites linking above
